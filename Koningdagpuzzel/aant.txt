database:
i have some customernames
give me all corresponding complaints

i have some ids of customernames
give me the ids of corresponding complaints

hoe is een database anders?
adding data gives an id
there are relations. Suppose a customer has multiple complaint, i can say: customer.complaints.
in Clean i could write instead getComplaints customer, where customer is of type customerId and getComplaints is overloaded. All are still in the shared environment i guess?

how does this hold up if the customer is deleted? It should always be a maybe value. 

kan ik dit nu ook al doen?
