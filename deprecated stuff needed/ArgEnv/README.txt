The ArgEnv package provides a Clean interface to the command line
arguments and the environment variables. 

This is the README for the Windows version. The Windows version has
been tested on Windows XP with Clean 2.1, but it should work with
all Windows versions with Clean 2.0 or better.

BUGS

There is no way to stop the Clean run-time system from interpreting
some of the command-line arguments.

If you start a Clean program from the command-line prompt, you still
have to "press any key" before the program quits.
